# Sample Chapter: Introduction to Cancer Biology

Cancer is a complex disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. The fundamental abnormality resulting in the development of cancer is the continual unregulated proliferation of cancer cells.

## Key Concepts

### Cell Cycle Regulation
Normal cells follow a tightly regulated cell cycle that includes growth, DNA replication, and division phases. Cancer cells often bypass these regulatory checkpoints, leading to uncontrolled proliferation.

### Genetic Mutations
Cancer development is typically initiated by genetic mutations that affect key regulatory genes. These mutations can be inherited or acquired through environmental factors such as exposure to carcinogens.

### Tumor Formation
When cancer cells accumulate, they can form tumors. Benign tumors remain localized, while malignant tumors can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant sites.

### Risk Factors
Several factors increase cancer risk, including tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet, lack of physical activity, and exposure to radiation or certain chemicals.

## Statistical Data
According to recent studies, approximately 40% of cancer cases are preventable through lifestyle modifications. The five-year survival rate for early-stage cancer detection is significantly higher than for late-stage detection.
