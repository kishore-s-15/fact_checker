    "Final Verdict": "Flagged for Review",
    "Full Analysis": "The assertion contains a self-contradictory phrase regarding mortality ('after lung and stomach cancers' for stomach cancer itself). Furthermore, the TAVILY_SUMMARY states stomach cancer is 'fifth in incidence' and 'third in mortality worldwide, after lung and liver cancers'. However, KNOWLEDGE_BASE_EXCERPTS (Chunk 1, 2016 data) indicate stomach cancer was 19th or 14th among leading causes of death, directly contradicting the 'third in mortality' claim. Due to conflicting information and the assertion's internal inconsistency, it is flagged for review.",
